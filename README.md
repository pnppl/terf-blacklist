# About

I'm trying to reduce the anti-trans garbage in my search results.

I don't want to go full nuke and block sites that might also rarely contain useful content, like mainstream news and social media. However, right-wing propaganda sites with zero redeeming qualities are fair game, as are individual articles and user accounts.

I don't filter titles or transphobic phrases, since I still want to get results from people using them in the course of covering or criticizing the anti-trans movement. Unfortunately, this means that I can't filter out, eg, every YouTube video posted by a transphobe.

Obviously, it's subjective, and there are edge cases. There is a lot of transphobia in the world, most of it casual. When in doubt, I'll ask myself whether it's shitting up my search results.

**You can help!** See [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/pnppl/terf-blacklist/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more info.

Note: "terf" is just a convenient shorthand; this is not limited to one particular brand of transphobe.
